The first hardware arrived! This includes the Motor Extension, Camera Extension, Core MAX10 and the Level Shifter Extension.

We now test the hardware and package them to ensure the best experience you can get with FPGA development boards.

You can buy the hardware soon in our [shop](https://shop.vhdplus.com/).
