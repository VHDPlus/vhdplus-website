In this tutorial you learn how to build a verry loud 100W bluetooth speaker with light effects and an FPGA controller. So you can just expand the project and add your own features with the FPGA.

When you buy a normal commercial bluetooth speaker, they are not loud enough for outdoors. So we just made the box bigger to use the potential of the speakers and add an LED strip, so it even looks cool in the dark.
