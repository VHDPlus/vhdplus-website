## What is the tutorial about?

In this tutorial you learn how to use a camera and HDMI with an FPGA. You learn how to apply filters to the received images 
and finally create an object detection. 

## Why an FPGA?

While a processor has to:

1.  Save the image from the camera in the RAM
2.  Read the first pixel from the RAM
3.  Apply the first filter
4.  Write the new value back in the RAM
5.  Repeat that for all 300k pixel
6.  Repeat everything for each filter

An FPGA does everything at once. The first pixel from the camera is received and goes to the first filter.
The last pixel goes to the second filter and so on. You have multiple components that all work independently and 
don't reduce the quality or frame rate. Also the delay between receiving and the last filter is minimal.

We have a [really big, but well structured example](https://github.com/leonbeier/VHDPlus_Libraries_and_Examples/tree/master/Examples/Hardware/Input/Object_Recogition) for image detection, where you can see how all components are connected.<br/>
Click [here](https://github.com/leonbeier/VHDPlus_Libraries_and_Examples/tree/master/Examples/Hardware/Input/Object_Recogition) to open the example on GitHub. 

In the example, yellow, black, blue and white blobs are found. If there is a bigger yellow blob on the bottom and a smaller black or yellow blob on the top, these blobs are seen as one object and a cross is displayed at the position. The same for blue and white blobs. Finally Yellow/Black and Blue/White cones should be found in the image.

You have a lot of possibilities to change the HDMI output and optimize the object detection. Here are the first lines:

    CONSTANT Capture_Output      : NATURAL := 6;
    CONSTANT Force_Mono          : BOOLEAN := false;  --true forces the image to monochrome
    CONSTANT Capture_Color_Depth : NATURAL := 1;      --How many bits for each color
    CONSTANT Capture_Compression : NATURAL := 2;      --Higher value = less RAM but also less resolution
    CONSTANT Full_Image          : BOOLEAN := true;   --true -> full image with less resolution | false -> part of image with full resolution
    
    SIGNAL Color_Select          : NATURAL range 0 to 3 := 2;  --0 = Yellow 1 = Black 2 = Blue 3 = White
    
    .
    .
    .
```

You can set Capture_Output to 5 so you only output one color. By default the selected color is Blue, so you can change the parameters for blue blobs (`Bl_H_Min`, `Bl_H_Max`, ...) to try your own colors.

#### Important: Check the description of the CSI_Camera component. Here you can see what you have to do so the differential IOs for camera and HDMI work properly.

#### Make sure you set Camera_Enable to '1'

## Conclusion

It is pretty difficult to handle this many components, but if you take the example and adapt it to your needs, the object detection is easy like with a processor but at a way higher performance. This Project also has a lot of potential to be expanded and be used for Robots and other smart, high speed products.
