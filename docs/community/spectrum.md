## What is a Sound Visualizer?

In this tutorial, we want to use a microphone to record the ambient sound, then filter different frequencies out of the sound.
This is done by a so called "fast Fourier transform" and is usually a complex operation, but can quickly be made by an FPGA. 
Finally, we want to display the result with an LED matrix.

## The hardware

### Soldering

As there are no cheap level shifter boards pre-soldered, I highly recommend learning some soldering skills. You could go ahead and plug the headers in the holes, but this doesn't ensure a connection and that the headers stay in place. Also soldering is has multiple benefits and can be used for many possible projects. Here is a cheap [soldering station](https://amzn.to/36MKUEL).

Alternatively, here is a [more expensive level shifter](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/de/27023-Pmod-LVLSHFT-Digital-Logic-Level-Shifter) that comes pre-soldered.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWyz2Kz56s) is an example of how to solder the headers to the level shifter.

### Electronics

The [led matrix*](https://amzn.to/36XnIUH) has to be connected with through a level shifter with the FPGA board, as the matrix works with 5V. The level shifter converts the 3.3V outputs of the FPGA to 5V outputs. Here you can see how to connect the matrix:
![Motor connect](/img/community/Matrix_Connect.png)

5V and GND have to be connected with HV and GND of the level shifter and VCC and GND of the matrix. 3.3V has to be connected with LV of the level shifter. The 3 I/Os of the FPGA have to be connected with the LV I/Os of the level shifter. The LV I/Os then with the matrix.

To connect the microphone, all you need to do is connect 3.3V and GND of the microphone with 3.3V and GND of the FPGA and connect the rest of the pins (except for SEL) with the FPGA I/Os. 

## The software

Start by creating a new project, and import the MAX7219_Interface library folder, the Spectrum_Analyzer library folder, the I2S_IN and the SPI library.
**Important:** make sure that you assign Brightness and Shutdown values or remove them from NewComponent. Also Config has to change from '0' to '1' when the matrix is connected.
Now you can copy this example:

This example displays the analyzed frequencies with an 8x32 LED matrix.

Make sure that you choose the correct FPGA Pins that are connected with DIN, CL and CLK, that 3.3V is connected with the level shifter and that 5V is connected with the level shifter and the matrix.

You can find the full example [here](https://github.com/leonbeier/VHDPlus_Libraries_and_Examples/tree/master/Examples/Basics/Spectrum_Analyzer).

## Conclusion

## Possible problems
### Matrix is dark
1. Check is everything connected properly. (Is 3.3V, 5V and GND connected? Does the level shifter have a connection? Are the correct pins used?)
2. Is the program correct? (Shutdown => '0'? Does LED_Matrix_Config change from '0' to '1' when the matrix has power?)
3. Does the matrix have a MAX7219 IC?
4. Check if the I2S_Interface_IN_Data_L data changes, so the microphone works properly. This code outputs the value with the matrix:
```vhdp
While(true)
{
    For(i IN 0 to 17)
    {
        LED_Matrix_Panel_Bitmap(i)(0) <= I2S_Interface_IN_Data_L(i);
    }
    
    --Update image -> show already defined image
    LED_Matrix_Update     <= '0';
    Step { LED_Matrix_Update <= '1'; }
    
    Wait(50ms);
}
```
### Last column always on
Try to play around with the offset constant. The last column is the one for the lowest frequency and an offset is interpreted as a very low frequency.
### Not sensitive enough
You can set a lower value as volume_divider to increase sensitivity.
