### Breaking ‚ö†Ô∏è
This update changes the way settings are loaded. 
This means your current settings may be lost. This is a one time change that had to be done before 1.0, sorry ü•≤.
Some packages may have to be reinstalled too in order to set their paths again.

### GHDL with GHW
This update adds the option to use the GHW file format with GHDL. This increases simulation speed by almost 50%, but requires GTKWave to run.
It can be activated with `Settings -> Use GTKWave` and `Settings -> Use GHDL GHW` after installing GTKWave.

### Other changes
- Added option to restore package paths
- Internal refactorings
- Fixed operator correction in certain situations

## 0.10.9.4

- Correct wrong cruvi LS definitions on Max10 boards
- Fix saving in create window
- Add error on missing components

## 0.10.9.3

- Fix missing cruvi extension views

## 0.10.9.2

- Fix errorlist style and sorting
- Drastically improved performance on files with lots of errors
- Fixed a possible crash

## 0.10.9.1

- Fix button visibility if no project is open
- Hint when trying to open new project in Quartus
- Fix possible crash

## 0.10.9.0

### New Toolbar Design
We simplified the design to make it more minimalistic.
This way the IDE should feel more familiar for beginners. Shortcuts, to control Arduino or NIOS CPUs are only shown when you really need them.
This change is still experimental and we expect to improve it in future releases.

If you find any bugs or need help, please join our [Discord](https://vhdplus.com/discord)!

### Fixes
