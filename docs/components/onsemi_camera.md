The IAS Camera and Display extension allows to connect OnSemi cameras with IAS connector to an FPGA development board with CRUVI HS connector. It features an HDMI port that can be used to output the image of the camera. The power supply and oscillator for the camera is also on board, so you just have to connect the extension with FPGA board and the camera to have a working system.
This can be used to program object detection, make your own safety camera and much more. 
With the IAS connector with 4 MIPI CSI-2 lanes and a standard HDMI port, you are very flexible with the choice of camera and display you want to connect.

## Camera Overview

The IAS Camera Extension uses the CRUVI HS connector. The IAS camera connector and HDMI connector are using differential pairs for high-speed data transfer, so you can capture and display HD video with high frame rates.

## Tutorials
Check out [this tutorial](/docs/community/neural_net) to see how to use this extension for a neural net on the FPGA. 

You can find the default project with color detection [here on Github](https://github.com/leonbeier/ias_demo).
