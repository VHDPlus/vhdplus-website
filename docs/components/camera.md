The Camera and Display extension allows to program object detection, make your own safety camera and much more. 
It supports state of the art CSI cameras like the Raspberry Pi Camera and standard HDMI, so you don't have to mess with outdated standards and get the best image quality.

## Camera Overview

The Camera Extension uses the CRUVI HS connector. The CSI camera connector and HDMI connector are using differential pairs for high-speed data transfer, so you can capture and display HD video with high frame rates.

Check out [this tutorial](/docs/community/camera) to see how to use the extension.
