The CYC5000 FPGA Development Board is for everybody who got to the limits of the MAX1000 or Core MAX10. With a CRUVI High Speed connector, higher LVDS speeds, three times more logic elements (25,000) and a faster USB interface, the CYC5000 is ideal for camera applications and real time AI image recognition. Still you have an external SDRAM, flash and programmer like with the MAX1000 to realize all kinds of projects with just one tiny development board.
Together with the VHDPlus KI Libraries, the CYC5000 can offer image recognition with way higher frame rates and shorter delays than any general purpose microcontroller. Also the energy efficiency is way better than solutions with GPU, which makes the CYC5000 ideal to be implemented in portable products with camera.

## CYC5000 Overview

> :warning: 3.3V I/O Voltage! Use Level Shifter to Connect 5V Hardware

The Trenz Electronic TEI0050-01-AAH13A is a small powerful FPGA module integrated an Intel Cyclone V FPGA, 8 MByte SDRAM and 8 MByte Flash. The CYC5000 is based on the Cyclone V FPGA from Intel and is a complete production board, designed for evaluation and final products.

With the onboard Reset-Button, the FPGA loads the program from flash that was last programmed with long-term programming.

### Software

Don't be overwhelmed by all the features of the CYC5000. Because of the deep integration in the VHDPlus IDE, you don't have to think about where to connect the SDRAM and how to set the I/O voltage. The I/Os are already defined in the libraries and in the graphical editor, you can can just click on the pin to connect.

### Reasons for an FPGA

#### 1. Speed
With an FPGA you can not only program software, but also hardware. Here is a quick comparison:

|                        |Software                                      |Hardware         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|Parallel Processes      |Usually 1                                     |As many as needed|
|Cycles for one operation|From 4 up to dozens<br/>depending on operation|1                |
|Operations per Cycle    |1                                             |As many as needed|

If you need the speed, you program hardware and for the rest you can still put a processor on the FPGA.

#### 2. Versatility
Normally you have e.g. 8 PWM pins and 2 UART, 1 SPI and 1 IÂ²C controller. With an FPGA you just take the UART component from the libraries and add it to your design as often as you want. <br/>
But also protocols that are not used that often, like IÂ²S for audio data, are no problem.

#### As Arduino
**IMPORTANT:** By programming the hardware with VHDP, the FPGA is much faster. This overview only compares the processor you can add to your FPGA design.

|           | VHDP Core                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Type      | 32 Bit                            |
| Frequency | 116 MHz (50 MHz default)          |
| RAM       | 65.7 Mb                           |
| Flash     | 64 Mb                             |

You get more speed and RAM so even image processing gets possible. Next to the processor, you can add additional parallel processes to e.g. control a motor.
